				<h1>About<br/><span class="bold-accent">Me</span></h1>

        <p>Hi there! I'm Ashley Cooper, or Cooper for short. I would say I took an unusual path towards design. After graduating with an IT degree I was slowly drawn into a graphic design from a manager who saw my potential. I've always loved drawing and creating designs but never thought I would make it as a graphic designer. I'm proving myself wrong and pushing forward through a graphic design certificate program through the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. I'll graduate from the program this summer.</p>

        <p>What's next for me? I'm not sure. I do know that I'll continue to push my design aesthetic and my skills to continue my graphic design education. I'm excited for the next path I take.</p>

				<h2>Let's Work Together</h2>

				<p>Need help with a project? I'm here to help! Email me details on what you want to accomplish and I can help make it a reality.</p>
